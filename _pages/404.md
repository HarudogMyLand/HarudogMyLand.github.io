## 404: Page Not Found
Oh,no...
Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist. But why?
You can try the following solutions:

- Check the URL for typos or mistakes.
- Click [Harudog](https://harudogmyland.github.io/) back to homepage...
- Use the search function to find the page you are looking for. (Did I add it?)

Anyway if you still need help, feel free to contact me at [this address](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UT42167xb?t=2.0)
