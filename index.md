Hi, I am **Harudog**. Currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at **Beihang University (BUAA)** in Beijing, China.

## 🏝️ About This Web

This website serves as **Harudog's blog and academic webpage**. Though I have no talent in academy.

I built this site to be a **shared oasis of knowledge and technology**, as well as a sanctuary for **thoughts and reflection**. In the fast-paced digital era, I hope to cultivate a small garden here to document my journey in CS, share technical notes, and occasionally ramble about life as a "struggling student."

## 🐾 What is "Harudog"?

You might be wondering about the name and the avatar.

**"Harudog"** is a series of self-set Original Characters that I have designed. It represents my projection in the digital world—curious, sometimes struggling, but always exploring.

Whenever I am coding, writing, or drawing, Harudog is the persona that accompanies me.
